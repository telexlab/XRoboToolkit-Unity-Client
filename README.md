## Feature list
- **Pose sync between XR device and robot PC**
  Transmits pose data from the XR headset to the robot-side PC for robot teleoperation.
- **Local pose and stereo vision data collection**
  Synchronously records stereo vision and pose data collected from the XR headset, stored in the device's `/Download` directory.
- **Remote stereo vision sync between two XR headsets**
  Transmits stereo vision from the robot-side headset to operator-side for 3D display.
- **Remote stereo vision sync between PC camera and XR headset**
  Transmits stereo vision from the robot-side PC camera to operator-side headset for 3D display.
## Feature instructions

### Pose sync between XR device and robot PC
1. Connect robot PC and Pico 4 Ultra under the same network
2. On robot PC, run service:
   - **Windows**: Run `\Program Files (x86)\roboticsservice\runService.bat`
   - **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian x86)**: Run `/opt/apps/roboticsservice/runService.sh`
3. Open app XRoboToolkit on Pico 4 Ultra

If the PC service is running successfully, when you open the app on Pico headset, you will receive a prompt window for server connection. Point to the IP address and click it with the trigger button on the controller.

<div align="center">
  <img src="Docs/pc_service_connection.png" alt="pc_service_connection" width="387"/>
</div>

The main panel will display "WORKING" if connection is established.

<div align="center">
  <img src="Docs/pc_service_connected.png" alt="pc_service_connected" width="394"/>
</div>

On the main panel, select preferred pose information to be synced, such as head tracking, controller tracking, or body tracking. If your headset and PC have established connection, then the pose data will be synced to PC when "Send" is toggled On. When "Switch w/ A Button" option toggles On, you may also use "A" button on the right controller to toggle "Send" On or Off during data syncing.

### Local pose and stereo vision data collection

**Note:** At this moment, camera data collection still requires special approval through Pico's enterprise service.

On the main panel, select preferred pose data to be collected, click Record. You will see a brief blur effect on the screen, record button will turn red, and camera status will turn to 6. When you finish recording, press recording button again to end the collection session. The video files and pose files will be saved on your local headset. You may also click "Save Camera Parameters" to save camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters for the local headset.

### Remote stereo vision sync between two XR headsets

1. Connect both XR headsets to the same network.
2. Make sure that the camera to be used as the camera source has VST camera permission (requires special approval).
3. Open **XRRoboToolkit** on both headsets.
> **Note:** The headset serving as robot eyes (H1) should have the camera permission enabled, while the other headset (H2) is for the human operator side.
4. H1: Remember the IP of the VR headset and **DON'T DO ANYTHING**.
5. H2: On the Camera panel, Select **PICO4U** as the video source, Click Listen, input H1's IP, and click Confirm.
6. H2: You should now be able to see the live camera. Press B button on the right-hand controller to switch between side-by-side views and stereo-3D views.
7. H2: If you close the live camera window, you can simply repeat Step 5.
8. If you want to stop the camera streaming, quit **XRRoboToolkit** on H1 and H2.

### Remote stereo vision sync between ZED camera (Orin) and XR headset

1. Clone [XRoboToolkit-Orin-Video-Sender](https://github.com/XR-Robotics/XRoboToolkit-Orin-Video-Sender.git) on Orin.
2. Build 
3. Run the following command on Orin:
   ```bash
   ./OrinVideoSender --listen <IP of Orin>:13579
   ```
4. Open **XRRoboToolkit** on the XR headset.
5. On the Camera panel, select "ZEDMINI" as the video source.
6. Click "Listen", input the IP of Orin, and click Confirm.
7. You should now be able to see the live camera. Press B button on the right-hand controller to switch between side-by-side views and stereo-3D views.
8. If you close the live camera window, you can simply repeat Step 6.
9. If you want to stop the camera streaming, quit **XRRoboToolkit** on the XR headset and stop the OrinVideoSender on Orin.

- **Universal**:
  Displays build result dialog

### Core Interfaces
- **Hardware Interaction Layer**
  - PICO Enterprise API Calls (Requires Device Permissions)
    ```csharp
    PXR_Enterprise.SwitchSystemFunction(SystemFunctionSwitchEnum.SFS_SECURITY_ZONE_PERMANENTLY, SwitchEnum.S_OFF);
    PXR_Enterprise.OpenVSTCamera(); // Enable VST Passthrough Camera
    ```

- **Image Processing Pipeline**
  - Android Native Decoder Bridge
    ```csharp
    private static AndroidJavaObject _javaObj = new AndroidJavaObject("com.picovr.robotassistantlib.MediaDecoder");
    public static void initialize(int unityTextureId, int width, int height) {
        GetJavaObject().Call("initialize", unityTextureId, width, height);
    }
    ```

- **Network Transport Layer**
  - Asynchronous UDP Data Reception
    ```csharp
    UdpClient client = new UdpClient(port);
    BeginReceive();
    void BeginReceive() {
        client.BeginReceive(ReceiveCallback, null);
    }
    void ReceiveCallback(IAsyncResult ar) {
        IPEndPoint remoteEP = null;
        byte[] data = client.EndReceive(ar, ref remoteEP);
        // Data parsing...
    }
    ```

- **Data Synchronization Mechanism**
  - `TcpHandler → NetPacket`: Data packet encapsulation
  - `NetPacket → ByteBuffer`: Serialization processing
  - `ByteBuffer → Socket`: Asynchronous transmission
  - `Socket → TcpHandler`: Callback handling

- **Unity Business Logic**
  - IP Address Validation
    ```csharp
    if (!IPAddress.TryParse(ip, out _)) {
        SetRemind(LogType.Error, "The IP format is incorrect!");
        return;
    }
    TcpHandler.Connect(ip); // Trigger TCP connection
    ```

### Architecture Overview
- **Cross-Platform Hybrid Architecture**:
  Unity C# layer and Android Java layer communicate via JNI bridge for hardware-accelerated encoding/decoding.

- **Dual Data Channels**:
  - Video Stream: 60 FPS with adaptive QoS
  - Pose Data Channel: 90Hz with low-latency priority

- **Thread Model**:
  | Thread Type          | Responsibilities                          |
  |----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
  | Main Thread          | UI rendering & user input handling       |
  | Worker Thread        | Video encoding/network transmission       |
  | GL Thread            | OpenGL ES texture operations              |

- **Memory Management**:
  Uses ring buffer for video frames to prevent GC stutter.

- **Fault Recovery**:
  - Automatic TCP reconnection
  - Keyframe retransmission support for video decoding

- **Key Performance Metrics**:
  | Metric                     | Value                        |
  |----------------------------|------------------------------|
  | End-to-End Latency          | ~100ms (720P *2 @60FPS)          |
  | Pose Data Packet Size       | 56 bytes/frame               |
  | Video Encoding Bitrate      | 5 Mbps                      |
  | Network Fault Tolerance     | 3 retries + FEC              |

### Q&A

- Q: Can not sign the application

![unable_to_sign.png](Docs/unable_to_sign.png)

A: Please refer to this [link](https://developer-cn.picoxr.com/en/document/unity/number-of-apks-associated-with-a-key-exceeds-limit/) for the solution.

- Q: No entitlement info ......

![no_entitlement](Docs/no_entitlement.png)

A: Connect the headset to public internet and run it.

- Q: Failed to connect on Linux.

A: Ensure the PC and headset are in the same WiFi network. Run the 3D application first and then run the Headset App.

- Q: How to update the video source? [V1.1.0+]

A: Do the following steps:
```bash
# pull the file first
adb pull /sdcard/Android/data/com.xrobotoolkit.client/files/video_source.yml
# edit the video_source.yml
# push the file back
adb push video_source.yml /sdcard/Android/data/com.xrobotoolkit.client/files/video_source.yml
```

- Q: How to revert the video source to default? [V1.1.0+]

A: Run `adb shell rm /sdcard/Android/data/com.xrobotoolkit.client/files/video_source.yml`.

- Q: The number of tracker on PC-service is 0, why is that?

A: The PC-service will only show the number of trackers when Unity app use object tracking mode. If you choose full body mode, the output will be 24 joints of human body. please refer to this code [link](https://github.com/XR-Robotics/XRoboToolkit-PC-Service-Pybind/blob/main/examples/example_body_tracking.py )

- Q: I cannot get vision captured by the Pico 4U, how to solve it?
  
A:  Please contact Pico enterprise team to get camera access. After that enable the camera access in XRobotoolkit app in the headset.
